# A Statistical Analysis of Donald Trump's Twitter Usage

## A Note on the Format
This project was made in the Jupyter iPython Data Science Notebook, and the HTML file in the repository was exported from said notebook. Unfortunately, I no longer have the original Python code, though it is all preserved in the HTML file and could easily be copy/pasted back into an IPYNB file. 

## Overview
I decided that this would be an interesting project when I stumbled upon the Trump Twitter Archive, an archive of every tweet (even the deleted ones) sent out by Donald Trump since he joined Twitter in 2009. Thus, I decided that I would find a good Python library for generating word clouds, and I used Pandas to organize the data from the archive so I could visualize it in a series of graphs and word clouds that illustrated Donald Trump's tweeting habits in four different time periods: the period before he ran for president, the period while he was president, the period in which he was president-elect but had not yet been inaugurated as president, and the period in which he has been president (up to present).

## Going Forward
If I were to revisit this project, I think I would go much more in-depth with the sentiment analysis of his words, so I could judge his sentiments with more objectivity and specificity, rather than just qualitatively observing the word clouds.
